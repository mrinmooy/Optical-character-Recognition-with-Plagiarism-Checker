# Optical-character-Recognition-with-Plagiarism-Checker

This is an Artificial Inteliigence project built along with my project mates.

First we built a plagiarism checker in Python using the scikit-learn library that compares every pair of text file in the same folder and outputs the percentage of similarity among them.

Then, as an add on we used an open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine called Tesseract to convert text from image files to .txt files. Now we can use the previous plagiarism checker code to find percentage similarity between text im images as well.
We used pytesseract module in python to integrate the OCR in our project.
